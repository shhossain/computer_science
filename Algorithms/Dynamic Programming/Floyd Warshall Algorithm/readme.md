## Floyd Warshall Algorithm 

The Floyd Warshall Algorithm is for solving all pairs shortest path problems. The problem is to find the shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a given edge-weighted directed Graph. 

**Example:**
```
Input:  graph[][] = { {0,   5,  INF, 10},
                               {INF,  0,  3,  INF},
                               {INF, INF, 0,   1},
                               {INF, INF, INF, 0} }
which represents the following graph
             10
      (0)——->(3)
        |              /|\
     5 |               |  1
        |               |  
       \|/             |
      (1)——->(2)
              3 
Output:

Shortest distance matrix
    0        5      8       9
 INF       0      3       4
 INF     INF    0       1 
 INF     INF    INF    0
 ```
 - Initialize the solution matrix same as the input graph matrix as a first step. 
 - Then update the solution matrix by considering all vertices as an intermediate vertex. 
 - The idea is to one by one pick all vertices and updates all shortest paths which include the picked vertex as an intermediate vertex in the shortest path. 
 - When we pick vertex number k as an intermediate vertex, we already have considered vertices {0, 1, 2, .. k-1} as intermediate vertices. 
 - For every pair (i, j) of the source and destination vertices respectively, there are two possible cases. 
 - k is not an intermediate vertex in shortest path from i to j. We keep the value of dist[i][j] as it is. 
 - k is an intermediate vertex in shortest path from i to j. We update the value of dist[i][j] as dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
