# Cycle Detection
A cycle is a path of length greater than 2 that starts and ends at the same vertex. A cycle may contain self-loops. A cycle may also contain multiple edges between two vertices.

## Types of Cycle
* Simple Cycle
* Self Loop
* Multiple Edges

## [Undirected Graph](Undirected%20Graph/readme.md)
* [DFS](Undirected%20Graph/DFS/readme.md)
* [BFS](Undirected%20Graph/BFS/readme.md)
