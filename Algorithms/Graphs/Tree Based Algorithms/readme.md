# TREE
You might be wondering why this data structure is being explained again as it is already present in the data structures directory. That is because this is a special kind of a data structure that can be called as a special form of  a graph.  A graph containing n nodes and n-1 edges can be called a tree provided all the nodes are connected to each other. This is used to solve a variety of different problems especially in competitive programming.
