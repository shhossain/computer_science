# Variable Length (Sliding Window Algorithm)
Variable length window is a technique used to solve problems related to subarrays, sublists or substrings of a variable length which offers maximum/minimum sum or value. Basically, it is a computational technique which aims to reduce the use of nested loop and replace it with a single loop, thereby reducing the time complexity ie compact that O(N^2) --> O(N) through this technique.
