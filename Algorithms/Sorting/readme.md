## Sorting
Sorting is the process of arranging a list of items in a particular order. For example, if you had a list of names, you might want to sort them alphabetically. Or if you had a list of numbers, you might want to put them in order from smallest to largest. Sorting is a common task, and itâ€™s one that we can do in many different ways.
