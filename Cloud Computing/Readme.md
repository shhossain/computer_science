# Introduction to Cloud Computing:
Cloud computing is the ability to access information and applications over the Internet. Cloud computing allows users to access applications and data from any location, as long as they have an Internet connection.

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center.

Cloud computing is a type of Internet-based computing that provides shared computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand.

It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

# Types of Cloud Computing Services
#### There are three types of cloud computing services:

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Infrastructure as a service is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers computer infrastructure — typically a platform virtualization environment — as a service. Customers are able to access and use the provider’s infrastructure, which typically includes operating systems, storage, and networking resources, over the Internet.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Platform as a service is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers a computing platform — typically a set of software tools — and infrastructure over the Internet. Customers are able to access and use the provider’s platform to develop, run, and manage applications.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
Software as a service is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers software over the Internet. Customers are able to access and use the provider’s software, typically through a web browser, while the provider manages the infrastructure and security.

# Essential Cloud Characteristics 

1. On-demand self-service
2. Broad network access
3. Resource pooling
4. Rapid elasticity
5. Measured service

### On-demand self-service

Allows provisioning of resources using self-service interface. Automatically provisioning handles without requiring human interaction with service provider. Facilitates consumer to leverage “ready to use” services or, enables to service catalog.

### Broad network access

Resources are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that
promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms.

### Resource pooling

The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-pace model. Different physical and virtual resources dynamically assign and reassign according to consumer demand.

### Rapid elasticity (Scalability)

Services can be elastically provisioned and distributed based on the demand. Automatically to scale rapidly outward and inward proportionate with customer demand.The resources available for provisioning unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.

### Measured Service

Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability.

# Cloud Deployment Models

### Private Cloud

In a private cloud model, the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers . It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.

### Public Cloud

In a public cloud model, the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned, managed, and
operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud
provider.

### Community Cloud

In a community cloud model, the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from
organizations that have shared concerns.

### Hybrid Cloud

In a hybrid cloud model, the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability.

# Advantages of Cloud Computing
There are many advantages to using cloud computing services, including:

### 1. Cost Savings:
 One of the biggest advantages of cloud computing is the potential for cost savings. When you move to the cloud, you no longer need to invest in and maintain your own on-premises infrastructure. Instead, you can rely on the provider’s infrastructure and pay only for the resources you use.

### 2. Increased Scalability:
 Cloud computing services are also highly scalable. If you need more resources, you can simply add them on demand. This can be a big advantage for businesses that experience seasonal spikes in demand or sudden growth.

### 3. Improved Reliability:
 Cloud providers invest heavily in ensuring their infrastructure is reliable and available. This can result in improved uptime and performance for your applications.

### 4. Increased agility: 
Cloud computing can help you be more agile in your business. By making it easy to provision resources on demand, you can quickly respond to changing business needs.

### 5. Greater focus on your core business:
 When you move to the cloud, you can offload the burden of maintaining your infrastructure to the provider. This frees up your time and resources to focus on your core business.

# Disadvantages of Cloud Computing
There are also some disadvantages to using cloud computing services, including:

### 1. Security concerns:
 One of the biggest concerns with cloud computing is security. When you move your data and applications to the cloud, you’re entrusting them to the provider. This can create concerns about data privacy and security.

### 2. Vendor lock-in:
 Another concern with cloud computing is vendor lock-in. When you use a specific provider’s services, you can become dependent on them. This can make it difficult and expensive to switch providers if you’re not happy with the service.

### 3. Internet dependence:
 Cloud computing services are also dependent on a reliable Internet connection. If your connection is slow or unavailable, you won’t be able to access your applications or data.

### 4. Compliance issues:
 Certain industries have strict compliance requirements. When you move to the cloud, you need to ensure that the provider can meet these requirements. Otherwise, you may be putting your business at risk.

### 5. Limited control:
 When you use cloud computing services, you’re giving up some control to the provider. This can be an issue if you’re not comfortable with
 
 
 ## Where Can I Access Cloud Computing?
There are many cloud computing services available to individual users, but the "big three" are:-

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Microsoft Azure

The service you choose will depend on:-

- The scale of your business
- Your business structure
- How much of the work you want to outsource
