    //Bug list:
    // Hitting any alphabet character when it asks for 1 2 or 3  will instantly close the program
    // Same bug happens when you enter any alphabet character except y when it asks you if you would like to play again
    // putting a number then y when asked for 1 2 or 3 will run the game then restart
    // putting y then a number when the game ask you if you want to play again will do so and chose the number automaticly
