// Contest Code: OCT221
// Problem Code: SINGLEOP1

/*  ------- PROBLEM STATEMENT ---------
Chef has the binary representation SS of a number XX with him. He can modify the number by applying the following operation exactly once:

Make X:=X⊕[X/(2)^y] -> (^ deontes raised to the power here)
, where(1≤Y≤∣S∣) and ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Chef wants to maximize the value of X after performing the operation. Help Chef in determining the value of Y which will maximize the value of X after the operation.
