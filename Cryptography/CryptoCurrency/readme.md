## Crypto Currency
Crypto currency is a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems. The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database. A defining feature of a cryptocurrency, and arguably its most endearing allure, is its organic nature; it is not issued by any central authority, rendering it theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.

## Features of Crypto Currency are as follows:
1. Decentralized
2. Anonymous
3. Secure
4. Transparent
5. Immutable
6. Fast

## Types of Crypto Currency are as follows:
1. [Proof of Work](#proof-of-work)
2. [Proof of Stake](#proof-of-stake)

### [Proof of Work](ProofOfWork/readme.md#proof-of-work)
Proof of work (PoW) describes a system that requires a not-insignificant but feasible amount of effort in order to deter frivolous or malicious uses of computing power, such as sending spam emails or launching denial of service attacks. The concept was subsequently adapted to securing digital money by Hal Finney in 2004 through the idea of "reusable proof of work" using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.

2. [Litecoin](ProofOfWork/Litecoin/readme.md)
3. [Dogecoin](ProofOfWork/Dogecoin/readme.md)

### [Proof of Stake](ProofOfStake/readme.md#proof-of-stake)
Proof-of-stake is a cryptocurrency consensus mechanism for processing transactions and creating new blocks in a blockchain. A consensus mechanism is a method for validating entries into a distributed database and keeping the database secure. In the case of cryptocurrency, the database is called a blockchainâ€”so the consensus mechanism secures the blockchain.
