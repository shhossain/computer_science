## Array
An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations. 

This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array). The base value is index 0 and the difference between the two indexes is the offset.

### Example
```
let array = [4,3,8,1,0,14,6];
```

| Memory Location | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| 1000             | 4     |
| 1001             | 3     |
| 1002             | 8     |
| 1003             | 1     |
| 1004             | 0     |
| 1005             | 14    |
| 1006             | 6     |

Accessing an element in an array is done by indexing into it.
```
array[0] // 4 (index 0 is the first element) (1000)
array[1] // 3 (index 1 is the second element) (1001)
array[2] // 8 (index 2 is the third element) (1002)
array[3] // 1 (index 3 is the fourth element) (1003)
array[4] // 0 (index 4 is the fifth element) (1004)
array[5] // 14 (index 5 is the sixth element) (1005)
array[6] // 6 (index 6 is the seventh element) (1006)
```
#### Initiation of Array

for initiation of Arrays it is necessary to specify size of an Array

if C++:
for example if you wish to initate an array of 5 elements 
you have to write code as:

<datatype> arr_name[size]
int arr[5];

this will initialise array with 0 elements.
  
#### Time complexities of some basic array operations

| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------------|-------|
| Accessing an element             | O(1)     |
| Searching an element           | O(N)     |
| Inserting an element             | O(N)     |
| Deleting an element             | O(N)     |
