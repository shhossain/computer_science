## Hash Table

Hash Table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.

### Example 

```
Let hash function H(x) = [11,12,13,14,15]
// it will be stored at positions {1,2,3,4,5}
// in the array or Hash table respectively.
```
