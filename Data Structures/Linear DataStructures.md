## Linear Datastructures

The datastructures in which the data items are arranged in sequential order (i.e one after the other), those datastructures belong to the category of Linear datastructures.
In a linear datastructure all the data items are present in a single layer making the traversal of every data items possible in a single traversal pass.
The time complexity associated with linear datastructure increases with increase in data size.

### Examples 

#### Arrays
Arrays are datastructures which stores the data items in contiguos memory locations.

#### Stack
Stacks are datastructures which stores the data items in LIFO (Last In First Out) manner (Also can be said as FILO - First in Last Out).

#### Queue
Queues are datastructures which stores the data items in FIFO manner (First In First Out) manner (Also can be said as LILO - Last In Last Out).
