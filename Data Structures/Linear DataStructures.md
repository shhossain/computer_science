## Linear Datastructures

The datastructures in which the data items are arranged in sequential order (i.e one after the other), those datastructures belong to the category of Linear datastructures.
In a linear datastructure all the data items are present in a single layer making the traversal of every data items possible in a single traversal pass.
The time complexity associated with linear datastructure increases with increase in data size.

### Examples 

#### Arrays
Arrays are datastructures which stores the data items in contiguos memory locations.

#### Stack
Stacks are datastructures which stores the data items in LIFO (Last In First Out) manner (Also can be said as FILO - First in Last Out).

#### Queue
Queues are datastructures which stores the data items in FIFO manner (First In First Out) manner (Also can be said as LILO - Last In Last Out).

#### Linked List
Linked List can be defined as collection of objects called nodes that are randomly stored in the memory.
A node contains two fields i.e. data stored at that particular address and the pointer which contains the address of the next node in the memory.
The last node of the list contains pointer to the null.
