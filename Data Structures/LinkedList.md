## LinkedList
A linked list is a data structure that consists of a group of nodes where each node contains a data value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the list.

### Example
```
let list = [4,3,1,0,14,6];
```

| Memory Location | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| 1000             | 4     |
| 1001             | 1008  |
| 1002             | 1     |
| 1003             | 1004  |
| 1004             | 0     |
| 1005             | 1006  |
| 1006             | 14    |
| 1007             | 1010  |
| 1008             | 3     |
| 1009             | 1002  |
| 1010             | 6     |
| 1011             | 1000  |

Accessing an element in a linked list is done by traversing the list and finding the element at the correct index.
```
index 0 value is 4 with memory location 1000 and pointer to next node 1008
index 1 value is 3 with memory location 1008 and pointer to next node 1002
index 2 value is 1 with memory location 1002 and pointer to next node 1004
index 3 value is 0 with memory location 1004 and pointer to next node 1006
index 4 value is 14 with memory location 1006 and pointer to next node 1010
index 5 value is 6 with memory location 1010 and pointer to first node 1000
```

#### Time complexities of some basic Linked List operations

| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------------|-------|
| Accesing an element             | O(N)     |
| Searching an element           | O(N)     |
| Inserting an element             | O(1)     |
| Deleting an element             | O(1)     |
