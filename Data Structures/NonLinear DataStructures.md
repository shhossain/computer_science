## Non Linear Datastructures

The datastructures in which the data items are arranged in non-sequential order (i.e hierarchical), those datastructures belong to the category of non-linear datastructures.
In a non-linear datastructure all the data items are present in a different layer making the traversal of every data items possible in with only multiple passes (in most cases).
The time complexity associated with non linear datastructure remanins the same.

### Examples 

#### Trees
A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value and a list of references to other nodes (the “children”).

#### Graph
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(E, V).
