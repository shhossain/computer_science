## Queue
A queue stores a collection of data values in a FIFO (First In, First Out) order. The first element added to the queue will be the first to be processed (removed).\
A queue can only be accessed through its ends, referred as _head_ for its rear and _tail_ for its back.\
The implementation could be an array-like (static and contiguous) or a linked-list-like (dynamic and dis-contiguous).
### Common operations on Queue
#### Enqueue
Add item to the rear of the queue
##### Example
```
let queue = [4, 1, 0, 2];
queue.enqueue(5);
// queue is now [4, 1, 0, 2, 5]
```
#### Dequeue
Remove the item from the front of the queue
##### Example

```
let queue = [4, 1, 0, 2];
let head = queue.dequeue();
// head is 4
// queue is now [1, 0, 2]
```
#### Peek
Some programming languages provides `peek` method to allow checking the value of the current head without removing the value from the queue.
##### Example

```
let queue = [4, 1, 0, 2];
let currentHead = queue.peek();
// currentHead is 4
// queue remains [4, 1, 0, 2]
```

The above shows the implementation of a simple Queue.

There are more types of Queues: 
- Circular Queue
- Double Ended Queue

### Circular Queue

If the last position is full and the first position is empty, we can not insert an element in the first position in a Simple Queue. However this is possible if we use circular Queue, where the last element is connected to the first element forming a circle-like structure.

#### Example to show the Implementaion of Circular Queue

##### Dequeue and then enqueue
```
let size = 4
let queue = [4, 1, 0, 2];
let head = queue.dequeue();
// head is 4
// queue is now [ 1, 0, 2]

enqueue(8);
/* queue is now [8, 1, 0, 2]. This operation could not be done in a simple queue since the last position of the queue is still occupied. According to simple Queue the queue is full. */

```

### Double Ended Queue

Double Ended Queue or Deque is a type of queue where insertion and deletions can be done from both ends (front and rear).it does not follow FIFO rule (First In First Out).

#### Example to show the Implementaion of Double Ended Queue

##### Insert from front

```
let queue = [4, 1, 0, 2];
queue.InsertFront(9);
//The queue is now [9, 4, 1, 0, 2]
```
##### Insert from end

```
let queue = [4, 1, 0, 2];
queue.InsertEnd(9);
//The queue is now [4, 1, 0, 2, 9]
```
##### Delete from front

```
let queue = [4, 1, 0, 2];
queue.DeleteFront();
//The queue is now [1, 0, 2]. 4 has been deleted
```
##### Delete from end

```
let queue = [4, 1, 0, 2];
queue.DeleteEnd();
//The queue is now [4, 1, 0]. 2 has been deleted
```


There are 2 types of Deque:

* Input restricted:  
In this Input is restricted to one end only whereas deletion is possible from both ends.

* Output restricted:  
In this Input is deletion from one end only whereas insertion(input) is possible to both ends.
