# Data Structures
In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Types of Data Structures
- [Array](#array)
- [Linked List](#linkedlist)
- [Stack](#stack)
- [Queue](#queue)
- [Hash Table](#hashtable)
- [Heap](#heap)
- [Tree](#tree)
- [Graph](#graph)

## Array
An array is a data structure that stores a collection of data values in contiguous memory locations.

### Example
```
let array = [4,3,8,1,0,14,6];
```

| Memory Location | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| 1000             | 4     |
| 1001             | 3     |
| 1002             | 8     |
| 1003             | 1     |
| 1004             | 0     |
| 1005             | 14    |
| 1006             | 6     |

Accessing an element in an array is done by indexing into it.
```
array[0] // 4 (index 0 is the first element) (1000)
array[1] // 3 (index 1 is the second element) (1001)
array[2] // 8 (index 2 is the third element) (1002)
array[3] // 1 (index 3 is the fourth element) (1003)
array[4] // 0 (index 4 is the fifth element) (1004)
array[5] // 14 (index 5 is the sixth element) (1005)
array[6] // 6 (index 6 is the seventh element) (1006)
```

## LinkedList
A linked list is a data structure that consists of a group of nodes where each node contains a data value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the list.

### Example
```
let list = [4,3,1,0,14,6];
```

| Memory Location | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| 1000             | 4     |
| 1001             | 1008  |
| 1002             | 1     |
| 1003             | 1004  |
| 1004             | 0     |
| 1005             | 1006  |
| 1006             | 14    |
| 1007             | 1010  |
| 1008             | 3     |
| 1009             | 1002  |
| 1010             | 6     |
| 1011             | 1000  |

Accessing an element in a linked list is done by traversing the list and finding the element at the correct index.
```
index 0 value is 4 with memory location 1000 and pointer to next node 1008
index 1 value is 3 with memory location 1008 and pointer to next node 1002
index 2 value is 1 with memory location 1002 and pointer to next node 1004
index 3 value is 0 with memory location 1004 and pointer to next node 1006
index 4 value is 14 with memory location 1006 and pointer to next node 1010
index 5 value is 6 with memory location 1010 and pointer to first node 1000
```

## Stack
A stack is a data structure that stores a collection of data values in a LIFO (last in, first out) order.
