## What is Computer Network?

A computer network is a set of devices connected through links. A node can be computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending or receiving the data. The links connecting the nodes are known as communication channels.

Computer Network uses distributed processing in which task is divided among several computers. Instead, a single computer handles an entire task, each separate computer handles a subset.
 Computer networking allows for the connection of endpoints and devices to one another on LANs as well as to larger networks like the internet or private wide area networks (WAN). 

  The complexity of a particular network directly relates to the level of expertise needed to operate it. A major organisation, for instance, can have thousands of nodes and strict security specifications, such as end-to-end encryption, necessitating the use of expert network administrators to manage the network.

  ### Following are the advantages of Distributed processing:

- Security: It provides limited interaction that a user can have with the entire system. For example, a bank allows the users to access their own accounts through an ATM without allowing them to access the bank's entire database.

- Faster problem solving: Multiple computers can solve the problem faster than a single machine working alone.

- Security through redundancy: Multiple computers running the same program at the same time can provide the security through redundancy. For example, if four computers run the same program and any computer has a hardware error, then other computers can override it. 

## Features Of Computer network

- Reliability

## Computer Network Architecture

The physical and logical layout of the software, hardware, protocols, and data transmission media is referred to as computer network architecture. That is, how tasks are assigned to computers and how computers are organised.

### The two types of network architectures are used:

Computer Network Architecture
- Peer-To-Peer network
- Client/Server network

### Peer-to-Peer Networks
Workgroup or peer-to-peer networks are networks without an authentication server. When low security is necessary when there are only a few computers on a network, this paradigm works well. They are typical of networks in small offices or homes. All machines in a workgroup are capable of offering both client and server services.

#### Advantages Of Peer-To-Peer Network:
- It is less costly as it does not contain any dedicated server.
- If one computer stops working but, other computers will not stop working.
- It is easy to set up and maintain as each computer manages itself.

#### Disadvantages Of Peer-To-Peer Network:

- In the case of Peer-To-Peer network, it does not contain the centralized system . Therefore, it cannot back up the data as the data is different in different locations.
- It has a security issue as the device is managed itself.

### Client/Server network
The client-server paradigm, often known as the client-server architecture, is a distributed application framework that assigns duties to servers and clients that either share a system or connect via a computer network or the Internet. In order to use a service provided by a server, the client must make a request to another software. One or more applications are run on the server to share resources and divide work across clients.

A standard communications protocol that clearly defines the rules, vocabulary, and dialogue patterns to be utilised must be followed when communicating in a client-server connection using a request-response message pattern. The TCP/IP protocol suite is commonly used for client-server communication.

#### Advantages Of Client/Server Network:

- The centralised system is housed within a client/server network. As a result, we can effortlessly backup the data. 
- A dedicated server in a client/server network boosts the system's overall performance. 
- Because a single server manages the shared resources, security is greater in client/server networks. 
- Additionally, it speeds up the process of exchanging resources.

#### Disadvantages Of Client/Server Network: 

- Due to the need for a server with a lot of memory, client/server networks are expensive. 
- A server uses a Network Operating System (NOS) to provide clients access to resources, however NOS is quite expensive. 
- To oversee all the resources, a dedicated network administrator is needed.
